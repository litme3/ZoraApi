We aim to decentralize the industry of music, by allowing artists to own their data. That is why with Phase you can create a Profile which will mint an NFT and using Lit-Protocol will encrypt the informations that you judge valuable. To decrypt a production/art another creator needs to Follow you.
Using Lit-Protocl Access Control this will be generate a decryption of the data. 


The model we are using is a **Proof-Of-Recognition** :

- We want artists to be recognised for their art.
