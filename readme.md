## Why are we using Lit-Protocol ?

We aim to decentralize the industry of music, by allowing artists to own their data. That is why with Phase you can create a Profile which will mint an NFT and using Lit-Protocol will encrypt the informations that you judge valuable. To decrypt a production/art another creator needs to Follow you.
Using Lit-Protocl Access Control this will be generate a decryption of the data. 


The model we are using is a **Proof-Of-Recognition** :

- We want artists to be recognised for their art. 

## How it is done ?

//We are using Lit Actions to sign and decrypt data with PKPs.
//We grant access to sign with the PKP to a group of Lit Actions for ``` createProfile() ``` and ```follow()```




TO RUN DO : 

``` yarn and yarn dev ```
